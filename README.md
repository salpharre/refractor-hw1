### General Info

Project webpage was given to practice code refraction, and clean up code.

Using a pre-formed html, elements were changed to follow a more 

accesable, semantic, and logically structured html format. The linked 

stylesheet, which was also pre-made, was consolidated, selectors merged 

to decrease the size of the file.
